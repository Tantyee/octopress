I read your note, and I know just what you want to hear. <br>
It hurts less over time, but I’m not getting stronger. <br>
I just leave pieces behind. <br>
I can only fall so many times before I’m broke, unrecognizable. <br>
Now all I’ve left to give is the piece that still remains, and you bring the pieces back. <br>
Love, it only reconstructs the pain. <br>
As time fails to elapse, I’m finding you were everything to me.<br> 
Now my future and my past are ending tragically the same.<br>
